The code all lives inside the "src" directory

Demo.py has been copied into Instructions.py with the appropriate Task lines uncommented or added as needed.

Task 1 is complete

Task 2 has run successfully, but is now hanging on my machine. I suspect memory issues. It may be related to my own environment, but I've commented the part that creates the movie using ffmpeg, since that is what was hanging

Task 4 works, but does not create the movie file either, however that remains unimplemented due to time

Task 5 has a stub with nothing more than a 'pass' command.  It seemed so trivial that I thought I'd do it last, but ran out of time while delving into ffmpeg.

Overall, dealing with all of it got easier as I worked through it. I really enjoyed drawing heatmaps and constructing/exploding movies.  
Ultimately this data is very interesting and there are lots of ways to churn through it and display it.
